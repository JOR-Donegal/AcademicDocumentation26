I can submit a paper to one conference and be refused, and win a best paper award, with the same unedited content, at a different conference. The key starting point is to identify the requirements of the referees or you supervisor/grader. These notes identify my requirements only, check with individual lecturers for their requirements, as they may differ.</p> <p>In designing the assessment strategy for some modules, I use practical exercises and reports to introduce academic writing.</p> <p>When you are doing laboratory work you will be required to keep records of you work in a formal manner. There are several reasons for this.</p> <ol> <li>This is normal practice in Science and Engineering academic disciplines.</li> <li>It is a normal process carried out by working consultants, administrators and systems engineers and it is a practice which needs to become second nature to you.</li> <li>This is a record of the work you have done and as such provides the basis for your CA marking, to both your lecturer and the external examiner.</li> <li>We need to begin developing your skills in academic writing. The style you use here should be compatible with conference and journal papers.</li> <li>Some of the laboratory work you are doing will be of use to you in employment.</li> <li>Many of us keep our own work logs/method sections in cloud storage, as invaluable reference information. You may find your own lab books of use to you in your career. These documents are intended to provide some guidelines as to how to write a lab report, the fields of data required and the sort of content which should exist in each field.</li> <li>In commercial scientific work, if I am submitting a tender, I may have to include a methods section.</li> </ol> <p>In every case, the report should be written in academic language, with the body of text in the third person, past tense. Your writing should be concise, never use more words than you need to express what you want to say. You may use screenshots, but only where they communicate more meaning than you could do economically in words.</p> <p>All work must be entirely your own. Where you work collaboratively with another student or any third party (other than your lecturer) you must acknowledge the contribution in your conclusion. You should not at any stage, copy and paste from any source, even one you have referenced. Your list of references (if any) will normally appear at the end of the lab report. If you use a Large Language Model (LLM) for research, the same rules apply. You must include the output from the LLM in an appendix.</p> <p>See section 5.7 of the Institutes\u2019 Quality Manual (available through the main web site) for clarification as to what constitutes plagiarism.</p> <p>To begin a laboratory report, use the template provided in the course materials.</p> <p>When describing physical properties, only use SI units. In a real world project based in the US or UK, there may be exceptions to this. For all work on my modules, use SI units only.</p>"},{"location":"a/","title":"Citations","text":"<p>It is important to get your citation style right and most students will become familiar with basic referencing software during the modules in their program of study. In the past, I have used Zotero and Endnote, depending on the University or research group I was doing work with. Citavi is also very good. Check the library section of the University website to see what type of software you should use and to get some basic instruction.</p> <p>Faculties normally have a consistent bibliographic referencing standard and again, check the library section of the Institute website to get our current guidelines.</p> <p>Harvard Referencing is an Institute standard but is a bit clunky for reports/papers.</p> <p>If I am writing papers for IEEE or ACM conferences or journals, I use a more economical style. A number [X] is inserted at the point in the document where I am citing another author's work. At the end of the paper, the full reference [X] of the work is provided.</p> <p>Do a quick Internet search on IEEE referencing.</p> <p>For laboratory reports in this module, use the IEEE style.</p> <p>And when writing short reports, you may use the built in referencing in Microsoft Word.</p>"},{"location":"b/","title":"Document formats","text":"<p>You may submit your lab book and accompanying files in any appropriate format. However, if they are distorted or unreadable, you will lose marks.</p> <p>If you are submitting to a Git repo, I will often specify to do so in Markup.</p> <p>The safest submission format for documents is PDF. After you create the PDF, check to see that it is correct, that it has rendered diagrams etc. It is recommended that you submit written work in PDF format only. If you are working in MS Word and you have not updated tables of contents, etc. then the PDF will show errors!</p> <p>Do not use embedded files; any embedded objects may not render correctly on another system and they may be lost or not shown by the VLE.</p> <p>Code listings are safest submitted as plain text files.</p> <p>Log files from an SSH client like Putty can be an invaluable record of your work and can be included as an appendix.</p> <p>You can submit drawings or images in any standard format (JPEG, TIFF, etc).</p> <p>Diagrams can be submitted directly from Power Point or Visio but are best converted to PDF first.</p> <p>If your report is a single document, name it Lxxxxxxxx-ReportY.pdf, using your own L number, where Y is the assignment or report number.</p> <p>Any submission with multiple documents should be a single zipped folder with all the documents relating to that submission. Name the zipped folder Lxxxxxxxx-ReportY.zip, using your own L number.</p> <p>If in doubt, consult your lecturer.</p>"},{"location":"c/","title":"Report Layout","text":"<p>Generally, use the provided template and maintain the same styles, fonts and sizes, headings, etc. Introduce and conclude each section, this report should read like a narrative.</p> <p>Any laboratory report will start with some basic header fields, which need little explanation.</p>"},{"location":"c/#title-of-the-report","title":"Title of the report","text":""},{"location":"c/#name-of-the-studentresearcher","title":"Name of the student/researcher","text":""},{"location":"c/#college-number-lxxxxxxxx","title":"College number (Lxxxxxxxx)","text":""},{"location":"c/#date-submitted","title":"Date submitted","text":"<p>If you use the laboratory report template, these fields are all on the cover sheet.</p>"},{"location":"c/#descriptionabstract","title":"Description/Abstract","text":"<p>The fifth field of data in any report will be the description of the work being carried out or the hypothesis being tested. This may be as little as a paragraph (for example, when configuring a service on a server) or may run to &lt;= 400 words (when defining the scope of a complex investigation). Look through some academic papers and read the abstracts to get an idea of length and style. Do not cite references here.</p>"},{"location":"c/#aims","title":"Aims","text":"<p>The sixth field of data in any report will be the aims of the work being carried out or the hypothesis being tested. Ideally this section will consist of a short narrative and some definite, numbered, and itemized aims. We never use bullet points in a report! Do not cite references here.</p>"},{"location":"c/#method","title":"Method","text":"<p>The seventh field of the report will be method. This is where you will describe the steps completed during the laboratory work. You will begin by detailing equipment used (if any). Standard practice is that if you are using instruments, you include serial numbers and calibration certificate dates. On procedural work (for example, configuring servers or services) method may be the most substantial part of the laboratory report. The best way to consider what should be in this section is that it should provide adequate instructions for any other student/administrator to carry out the same work, without any other information source. It will normally consist of text and may include some screen shots. Where you are following a procedure from the lecturer\u2019s notes, there is little point in you repeating them, you can just reference the lecturer\u2019s notes; but do so with a formal reference. If you find a current best practice from a credible source, even better. However, the method section must contain more than a reference to a set of instructions or steps, you need narrative.</p> <p>Do not show your testing in this section, but you can refer to the tests in the results section.</p>"},{"location":"c/#results-and-testing","title":"Results and Testing","text":"<p>The eight section of the report will be the results and testing, and this is where you present the data relating to your work. In scientific investigation, we decide on the tests before we begin to gather data. If your aim was to evaluate performance, what specific tests will do so?</p> <p>Results are the pure data which emerges from an investigation, without interpretation. You state the facts as you have recorded them, without any bias towards your original hypothesis or aims. A good screen shot or two can enhance your results and confirm unambiguously that you have completed the work. If your report requires several screen shots/tables/figures, they are best placed in an appendix, with a figure or table number. Refer to these by figure/number from within the narrative. if you found any errors in the instructions/equipment with which you were provided, you should detail them in such a way that they can be remedied.</p> <p>At the end of this section, briefly discuss your results.</p>"},{"location":"c/#discussionconclusions","title":"Discussion/Conclusions","text":"<p>The final section of your report are your conclusions. In this section of your report, you discuss the results, you interpret them, and you assign significance to the results. It would be normal for the conclusions to tie closely to the original hypothesis or aims. You should state how long the work took. </p> <p>By award year, there is an expectation that you are reading widely. A conclusion will normally show evidence of independent study. The length depends on the work, but typically four paragraphs with references cited.</p> <p>Give a closing sentence.</p>"},{"location":"c/#general","title":"General","text":"<p>The final document should be readable and should have a natural flow.

The conclusions will be heavily weighted, and the lecturer will be looking for signs that the student can analyze and evaluate the results of the laboratory work and can combine the knowledge gained from lectures and independent learning. The conclusions should reference credible material from independent study.</p> <p>Check the marking rubric in each case before you commence work, as there may be some variation in the weighting. Marking is typically:</p> <p>Description (5%)</p> <p>Aims (5%)</p> <p>Method (10%)</p> <p>Results (10%)</p> <p>Conclusion (70%)</p> <p>Regardless of the level, lab books should be professional and well presented. No marks will be awarded for good presentation, this is expected. However, marks will be deducted for poor presentation, grammar, or spelling.</p> <p>Screen shots and images should never be presented in isolation (e.g., without text) and should only be used where they contribute to the information presented. All such images should be labelled with a figure number and description.</p> <p>Finally, use the template provided!</p>"}]}
