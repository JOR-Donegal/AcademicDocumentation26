# Document formats
You may submit your lab book and accompanying files in any appropriate format. However, if they are distorted or unreadable, you will lose marks.

If you are submitting to a Git repo, I will often specify to do so in _Markup_.

The safest submission format for documents is PDF. After you create the PDF, check to see that it is correct, that it has rendered diagrams etc. It is recommended that you submit written work in PDF format only. If you are working in MS Word and you have not updated tables of contents, etc. then the PDF will show errors!

Do not use embedded files; any embedded objects may not render correctly on another system and they may be lost or not shown by the VLE.

Code listings are safest submitted as plain text files.

Log files from an SSH client like Putty can be an invaluable record of your work and can be included as an appendix.

You can submit drawings or images in any standard format (JPEG, TIFF, etc).

Diagrams can be submitted directly from Power Point or Visio but are best converted to PDF first.

If your report is a single document, name it __Lxxxxxxxx-ReportY.pdf__, using your own L number, where Y is the assignment or report number.

Any submission with multiple documents should be a single zipped folder with all the documents relating to that submission. Name the zipped folder __Lxxxxxxxx-ReportY.zip__, using your own L number.

If in doubt, consult your lecturer.
