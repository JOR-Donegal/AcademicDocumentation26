# Citations
It is important to get your citation style right and most students will become familiar with basic referencing software during the modules in their program of study. In the past, I have used _Zotero_ and _Endnote_, depending on the University or research group I was doing work with. _Citavi_ is also very good. Check the library section of the University website to see what type of software you should use and to get some basic instruction.

Faculties normally have a consistent bibliographic referencing standard and again, check the library section of the Institute website to get our current guidelines.

Harvard Referencing is an Institute standard but is a bit clunky for reports/papers.

If I am writing papers for IEEE or ACM conferences or journals, I use a more economical style. A number [X] is inserted at the point in the document where I am citing another author's work. At the end of the paper, the full reference [X] of the work is provided.

Do a quick Internet search on IEEE referencing.

For laboratory reports in this module, use the IEEE style.

And when writing short reports, you may use the built in referencing in Microsoft Word.
